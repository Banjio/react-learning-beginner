# React Beta Docs Notes

## React Installation 

For a local installation you can do one of the following: 

1. Use a standalone index.html with content: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/main/static/html/single-file-example.html
2. Add it to an existing site https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/add-react-to-a-website
3. Use a toolchain to create an entire standalone react project &Rightarrow; Must famous (but not best for production ready code) is using npx create-react-app. The downside of this is that it cannot handel server-side features like dynamic routing and server-side logic (and has worse performance) (For that frameworks exist, e.g. next.js).
   1. Install node.js
   2. Run `npx create-react-app my-app`
   3. `cd my-app && npm start`
