# Tips by Scrimba

* First thing he does is creating his app structure (see how to create react app)


# Javascript

## Arrow functions

Allow for shorter function syntax 

```js
let myFunction = (a, b) => a * b;
```

or like this 

```js
hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

even shorter 

```js
hello = () =>  "Hello World!";
```

# React

## Setup for local development

* `npx create-react-app my-app` will create an app layout for you (Ensure Node.js is installed)

## Jsx 

* Extension to js syntax for displaying react components 
* Special syntax that supports html?
* [Read more](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
